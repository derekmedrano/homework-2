## Description
    This is a portfolio/landing page for all my scholarly and professional work. My motivation behind this project is not only to get a good grade I need, but more importantly to be able to use and build on it throughout my career. I now have a permanent place to store and showcase all my work.
    I learned the value of using responisve elements, especially flexboxes and sizing elements.
